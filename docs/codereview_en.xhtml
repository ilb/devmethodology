      <h2 id="Definition">Definition</h2>
      <p>Code review is the process of making pieces of source code available for other developers to review, with the <b>intention</b> of catching bugs and design errors before the code becomes part of the product.</p>
      <h2 id="Types_of_Code_Review">Types of Code Review</h2>
      <p>There are two types of code review: pre-commit and post-commit.</p>
      <p>Pre-commit review is a form of code review where code is reviewed <span>before</span> going into the codebase. In this method, a <a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/3.0/glossary/#term-diff-file">diff file</a> is uploaded to Review Board, which reviewers can comment on, and once thereâ€™s approval the code is committed to the repository.</p>
      <p>Post-commit review is where the code is reviewed <span>after</span> going into the codebase. The code is committed to the repository and, at some point later, the code is reviewed. Any fixes that need to be made are then committed again later.</p>
